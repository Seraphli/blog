## Things

I will going to build the algorithm known as DQN. I decide to use [openai gym][1] to reproduce the result described in [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning][2].
I notice that there are so many repositories about DQN, but a lot of them don't generate any benchmark for algorithms. So I think I need a benchmark and algorithm comparision, and I decide to write my own repository.
I think writing code is going to be painful, so I need to write down the pains I have.
