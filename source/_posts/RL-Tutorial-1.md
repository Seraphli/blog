Here are some important concept:

1. We: Intelligent agents, human or robot.
2. Policy: The way we make decisions.
3. Reward: Critiria about how well we did.
4. Environment: Where we can get our states and rewards.
5. State: Current situation we are in.
6. Experience: How we choose to react and how many rewards the environment gives us.
7. Expectation: Before we make a decision, we will consider how many rewards we will get by doing this.
8. Exploration: We sometimes will try a new action, and watch the result.
