## Stage #1

In this stage I will use a specific game, "Breakout", to test the whole structure. 

- [x] Figure out the observation given by openai gym.
- [x] Complete preprocessing part.
- [x] Model architecture build.
- [x] Network parameter replace mechanism.
- [x] Original experience replay.
- [x] Epsilon decay.
- [x] Link all part.
- [x] Add debug information output.
- [x] Save session parameter.
- [ ] Test algorithm on game "Breakout".

## Stage #2

In this stage I will continue building some parts for DQN.

- [ ] Add Tensorflow tensorboard support.
- [ ] Test algorithm on several games.
- [ ] Test on all games mentioned in the paper.
- [ ] Generate last three column of Extended Data Table 2.
